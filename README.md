# Impact-Jedi-Snap-Tracker-Server

This project was created to fulfill the Impact Jedi challenge. 

Although what's here wasn't exactly what they asked for, I took the opportunity to do a personal project, a manual deck tracker for the Marvel Snap card game. This project is still under construction, as I want to expand the project so that it can be online and share it with friends and interested parties.

Unit tests have not yet been implemented. Are in the near future plans

The project in this repository represents the backend of my project. I strongly recommend using it with the front-end, which is [in this repository](https://github.com/Leandro-Patricio/Impact-Jedi-Snap-Tracker-Web).
